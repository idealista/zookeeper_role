## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the role for your Ansible Playbook. Once launched, it will install an Apache ZooKeeper server.

### Prerequisites

#### To execute this role:

Ansible 2.8.6 version installed.

:warning: Inventory destination should be a Debian environment. Notice that you will need to [install Java](https://github.com/idealista/java_role) in that environment after execute this role.

#### For testing purposes:

* \>= Python 2.7 
* [Pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) 
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) as driver

:warning: As this role is ready to use in production, the image hosted in [Docker Hub]((https://hub.docker.com/r/idealista/zookeeper/)) is only for testing purposes. That image is deployed using *rolling tags* and major changes could break your tests. 

**We strongly do not recommend to use containers in production based on that image** (maybe it will be ready in future releases).

```
- src: idealista.zookeeper_role

  name: zookeeper
```

```
ansible-galaxy install -p roles -r requirements.yml -f
```

Use in a playbook:

    - zookeeper
```
